# Linearity2-PCA

This GitHub repo consists of three different applications of PCR in the form of Jupyter notebooks. It also contains the csv files for the notebooks and my report, "Applying Principal Component Analysis to Regression and Optimization".  

### ```Analysis of MTCars Data```
The mtcars data was collected during road tests by Motor Trend magazine in 1974. It consists of 11 variables quantifying various aspects of 32 automobiles. This notebook walks through the process of conducting PCA and PCR using the mtcars data. PCA is done both from scratch and from the sklearn PCA library.

### ```Analysis of Hitters Data```
The hitters dataset consists of 322 observations of major league baseball players on 20 variables. PCR is conducted to predict the playersâ€™ salaries based on the other 19 variables.

### ```Analysis of Breast Mass Data```
This notebook uses PCA for logistic regression to predict whether a breast mass is benign or malignant. The data consists of 10 cell nuclei characteristics (i.e. radius, symmetry, and compactness) within 357 benign and 212 malignant images. For each characteristic, the mean, standard error, and worst values are recorded, resulting in 30 independent variables.
